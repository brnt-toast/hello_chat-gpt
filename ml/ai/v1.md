Welcome to the Machine Learning Challenge List! Whether you're a beginner looking to hone your skills or an experienced practitioner seeking new challenges, this curated list offers a progression of machine learning tasks from easiest to hardest. Each challenge is designed to help you build proficiency in various aspects of machine learning, from basic classification tasks to advanced deep learning and reinforcement learning problems.

## Challenges

### 1. Binary Classification with Structured Data
   - **Description**: Perform binary classification using structured data (e.g., tabular data).
   - **Example**: Predict whether an email is spam or not.

### 2. Multiclass Classification with Structured Data
   - **Description**: Extend binary classification to multiclass classification tasks using structured data.
   - **Example**: Classify types of flowers based on their features.

### 3. Regression with Numeric Data
   - **Description**: Predict numeric values using regression techniques with numeric data.
   - **Example**: Predict housing prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms.

### 4. Image Classification
   - **Description**: Classify images into predefined categories using machine learning models.
   - **Example**: Identify handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.

### 5. Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Sentiment Analysis
   - **Description**: Analyze sentiment in text data using natural language processing techniques.
   - **Example**: Classify movie reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

### 6. NLP - Text Classification
   - **Description**: Classify text data into predefined categories using machine learning models.
   - **Example**: Categorize news articles into different topics.

### 7. Object Detection
   - **Description**: Detect and localize objects within images using object detection algorithms.
   - **Example**: Identify cars in images from a traffic surveillance camera.

### 8. Semantic Segmentation
   - **Description**: Assign semantic labels to each pixel in an image.
   - **Example**: Segment objects from medical images for diagnosis.

### 9. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
   - **Description**: Generate realistic data samples using generative adversarial networks.
   - **Example**: Generate images of human faces.

### 10. Reinforcement Learning in Complex Environments
   - **Description**: Train agents to make sequential decisions in complex environments using reinforcement learning techniques.
   - **Example**: Train an agent to play complex video games.
